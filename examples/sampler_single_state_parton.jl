# A common pitfall, when it comes to computing determinants, is a sudden drop in performance when the size of the matrix is more than ~ 100 x 100. This is because BLAS switches to a multi-threaded implementation by default, which gives worse performance than single-threading. Thi line sets the number of threads used by BLAS to 1.
